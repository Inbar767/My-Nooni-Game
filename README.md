<b> Welcome to My Nooni game </b><br>
</p>
<h2>Let's Start</h2>
The game begins with a girl named Pam requesting that you take care of one of her four unusual pets.<br><br>

After she finishes speaking, a window opens, allowing you to choose an egg and begin the game.<br>
The pet grows in three stages: first as an egg, then as a baby, and finally as an adult.<br>
The pet can play with you, eat, sleep, shower, and learn how to speak.<br>
Being petted, eating, sleeping, taking a bath, and playing are the pet's five basic requirements. If all goes down, the game is over.<br>
The game is relatively simple to comprehend, and each level begins with a dialog box in which Pam describes the level.<br><br>

Every screen has an escape button that may be used to return to a previous screen or end the game.<br>
Every screen has an audio button that can be used to play or pause music.<br>
You can pause the game at any time using the pause buttons on each level, speech state, and yard state.<br>
The pause mood can also be induced by removing the mouse from the screen. The game is continued by pressing the play button.<br><br>

In order to download the game and play with it, you need to have the SFML library.<br>

<h2>Notes</h2>
I worked alone to create the game using the C++ programming language and the SFML library. <br>
This game's graphics were created just for it.
